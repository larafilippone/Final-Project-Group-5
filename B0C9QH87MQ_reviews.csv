¬†Fantastic.  Great price, great purchase. Saw a few reviews mentioning sound/noise level?!? Geez! Certainly wish my Keurig was this quiet, freal!We've an old farmhouse frame home. Husband remodeled, adding approx 1k more sq ft, including 2 bathrooms, that do not get direct ""house heat"". Our sons bedroom is heated. His add-on bathroom is not directly heated.  It faces Northeast. Ergo, C-O-L-D!!! .....Or used to be, thank God!This item is pretty darned small.  It does give dimensions on listing....another gripe I read, the size.This lil guy packs a serious punch on freezing temps here in Northern Virginia. Son absolutely loves it. I love it.  In bathroom upstairs. Would not recommend nxt to a shaggy bath mat, as seen in pics, but upon checking air/heat flow, it blows out & up, never touching bath rug. We only utilize unit when using bathroom or bathing. It literally heats room up so fast, no need to ""preheat"" room.Either way, the timer & self heating governor do exactly as you'd hope.I seriously am buying another one (or 2), to stoke up the workshop and NE facing kitchen when needed. Seriously awesome product. Packs a punch. Efficient. No kiddin'üëç ‚ô•","Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars

"The heater is small, heats quickly and well and heats the area in much less time than my older, coil-type heater. It is a little louder, but not very bad and as it runs for a shorter time it's an acceptable trade off.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought this heater on Feb 1, 2023. It was just what I needed to finish out the winter in comfort. Put it away for the spring and summer, and pulled it out again in November. Two days ago (Dec 28), it died. Not sure what the problem is.But it worked great when it worked. Very warm, very safe. I loved it.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars

Its low noise level is a definite plus, ensuring a quiet and comfortable heating experience. The safety features, including overheat protection, offer peace of mind. Overall, a reliable and practical choice for personal heating needs.","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars

The 1500 and lower wattage ceramic heater is very small for the heat it emits. It has both tip over and overheat shutoff for your safety.The sides of the unit don't even get warm.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars

I bought this heater to put under my desk at work because it's always freezing in my office. Winter and summer.  This heater puts out much more heater than expected.  I can't even put it on high heat because it works so well!  Love it!  Definitely recommend it.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars

"The anti-tipping feature is really pleasant to have when you have a cat that knocks things over like it owns the place. It also has a limit switch, so if it gets too hot, it will also cut off. It's a space heater; it turns electricity to heat, which is 100% efficient, no matter what brand or type you have. I like this design because I can keep only my bedroom warm overnight during the (somewhat moderate Florida) winter when things get down to 45F without worrying about it cooking me.My only gripe is that the fan is kind of loud, and it is ALWAYS running, even when it has satisfied heating. It will heat to 72, and then the element will cut out, and then the fan will cool the element... and then nothing else happens. I would really like the fan to only run when the element is hot, because when it's confined to a small room without a rug or any sound dampening material at all, it's not as quiet as one would hope. This is not a deal breaker, but if this company produced a space heater that would automatically turn the fan off, I would upgrade to that heater in a heartbeat.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars

"Tho it‚Äôs not recommended, I bought this heater to warm up our bathroom in the morning for my wife who gets up a couple hours after me.For our bathroom, it takes just a few minutes to heat up the room so it‚Äôs pretty effective. For our bedroom, it take a a little longer but still does the trick.It is pretty easy to use. I set the temperature and put it on eco mode to make so it doesn‚Äôt overheat the bathroom. Then I‚Äôll set a timer for a couple hours to turn off so that it doesn‚Äôt feel too warm in the morning.The eco mode will switch between high heat, low heat, and just the fan as needed depending on what temperature you set in the heater.We‚Äôve never had the heater overheat. The decide itself doesn‚Äôt seem to get dangerous hot. Overall, we are very satisfied with this heater.","Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars

"This is only the second day with this heater.  So far it is a great little heater.I purchased it to take the chill off a work station in my garage, which is no easy task in new york in January. I received it yesterday and tried it for the first time last night. It not only took the chill off it kept me so warm I had to turn it to a lower setting. I used it today with the same result.So, so far it is a great little heater.","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars
